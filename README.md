Geocoding addresses with Geopy

geopy makes it easy for Python developers to locate the coordinates of addresses, cities, countries, 
and landmarks across the globe using third-party geocoders and other data sources.

Creating maps with Geopandas

GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. 
GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. 
Geometric operations are performed by shapely. Geopandas further depends on fiona for file access and matplotlib for plotting.
